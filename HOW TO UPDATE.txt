In our SDL2 usage, we require the includes to be prefixed SDL2/
(#include <SDL2/SDL.h> instead of just <SDL.h>)

this is required because we use three different deployments of SDL2:
1. Binaries (Windows)
2. find_package (Linux)
3. Build from source (CI)

SDL2's source natively does not have this prefix, but the distributions installed by linux package managers do.
To make 3. compatible with the rest, we move all headers in include/ to include/SDL2/

This requires these steps when updating:

1. Completely replace the contents of sdl2/ with the new files
2. Move all files in sdl2/include/ to a new subfolder sdl2/include/SDL2
3. Adjust the SDL2 CMakeLists.txt (NOT the top level one in this folder) as follows:

    - Point the general include to the subfolder instead of just ${SDL2_SOURCE_DIR}/include/
    In SDL 2.0.12 this was line 267, it should now look like this:
    
        # General includes
        include_directories(${SDL2_BINARY_DIR}/include ${SDL2_SOURCE_DIR}/include/SDL2)
